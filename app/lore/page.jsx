              While humankind still clambered to break the skin of the
              primordial soup, animal clans had long since ruled land and sea.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xs sm:text-sm md:text-base text-[#d3d3d3] font-medium">
              For millennia, harmony prevailed as the clans coexisted in
              balance, guided by the wisdom of seven ancient relics imbued with
              the essence of the natural world. Not one race ever dared name the
              ground beneath their matted claws, let alone claim it as their
              own.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xs sm:text-sm md:text-base text-[#d3d3d3] font-medium">
              However, this era of tranquility was instantly shattered when a
              great cataclysm befell the realm. A fissure in the cooling crust
              allowed demonic energy buried within to escape its exile and rain
              chaos across the infinite landscape above.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xs sm:text-sm md:text-base text-[#d3d3d3] font-medium">
              The once-mighty relics, sources of power and guardians of
              equilibrium, were lost, plunging the land into turmoil. With the
              relics gone, and under the newfound demonic influence, the
              delicate balance between the animal clans was disrupted, and
              ancient rivalries resurfaced with newfound intensity.

              While the animal clans fought for control, demonic chaos hurried
              human evolution exponentially. Their unique cunning and superior
              base intelligence quickly propelled them into a formidable
              adversary and notable frontrunner in the search for the lost
              relics.

              As the struggle for dominance escalated, alliances formed and
              fractured, and warriors from all corners of the inhabited world
              emerged to claim the relics as their own.

            <p className="text-xs sm:text-sm md:text-base text-[#d3d3d3] font-medium">
              Among them were the swift and cunning Doge Clan, whose agility and
              wit made them formidable opponents on the battlefield. The
              indomitable Bull Clan whose material greed grew with every passing
              day. The noble Katana Inu Clan, renowned for their strength and
              honor, fought with unyielding determination to restore order to
              the land. The Bear Clan, rich in ancient wisdom and noble
              practice, but not immune to the thirst for riches displayed by
              their Bull relatives, grew in power and stature.

              desires. Finally, Celestials were the unholy combination of the
              worst of human and the best of animal-kind - devoid of love and

              was from within these hallowed grounds that the relics of power
